            <li>3 table spoons of bottled mango habanero topping</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Light the barbecue. Remove the plastic wrap and foil from the pulled pork and place the meat, with the liquid, in the aluminum bowl. Keep the sauce aside for a while. Roast the pulled pork on the barbecue for about 25 min. Halfway through the cooking time, spread the meat with the sauce from the package.</li><br>
            <li>Spread the tortilla chips on an aluminum tray and heat for the last 5-8 min. on the barbecue next to the pulled pork.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the onion into wafer-thin half rings, using a mandolin if necessary. Place in a bowl and squeeze the lime over it. Stir and let stand until use. Cut the lettuce into thin strips.</li><br>
            <li>Drain the liquid from the pulled pork and place in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat for about 3 min until a thick sauce forms. Meanwhile, pull the pulled pork apart with 2 forks and mix the reduced sauce into the meat.</li><br>
            <li>Heat the cheese sauce in a saucepan 1-2 min. over medium-high heat. Divide the pulled pork, heated cheese sauce, mango habanero sauce, red onion and baby romaine lettuce among the tortilla chips and serve.</li><br>
