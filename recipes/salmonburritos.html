        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220 °C. Heat the spinach in a frying pan. Meanwhile, cut the salmon into cubes. Mix the spice mix from the package with the water.</li><br>
            <li>Stir the herb mix into the warm spinach. Add the salmon, stir and heat for 2 min. Add the garden peas and heat for 1 min. Mix the sauce mix from the packet with the crème fraiche and water to make a herb spread.</li><br>
            <li>Spread the tortillas from the package with half of the herb spread. Spread 3⁄4 of the spinach-salmon mixture on top. Roll the tortillas into burritos and place side by side in the baking dish. Spread the rest of the spinach-salmon mixture in a lane down the center of the rolls and spread the rest of the herb spread on top. Bake for about 10 min in the center of the oven.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>This dish is for three people. If you want to eat it for four, serve tortilla chips and a sweet and sour cucumber salad alongside.</p>
